WCMS Base Theme, based on _s
===

This is the "base theme" we created during today's lecture. It is based on the [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) (`_s`) starter-theme "sassify'ed", and we've added Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6 and some basic markup and styles, for example a primary menu with dropdown- and responsive support. We've also created a rough translation into Swedish of all the theme's strings.

Getting Started
---------------

Fire up the SASS pre-processor of your choice and instruct it to compile `/sass/style.scss` into `/style.css`, and you're good to go! The next step is up to you - making the theme awesome!

Good luck!
